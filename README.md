### Important Dates ( taken from club-provided syllabus )

##### Week 5/6 — April 16 & April 23, 2025
Development continues on in week 5 in preparation for the **mid-semester showcase in week 6**. Groups are now in the middle of the semester meaning that they will present what progress they have so far. The mid-semester showcase does not mean that groups have to be halfway done with their projects.

##### Week 7 — April 30, 2025
At this point **groups should be more than halfway done with their project** or close to finished in preparation for the final week as well as finals. Project managers should check with members on the final schedule to ensure projects are done and not rushed in the final week.

##### Week 8 — May 7, 2025
**Groups should be close to wrapping up their projects** or should be completely done with the projects. This week will be focused mainly on the final project showcase in which judges will determine who has the best project. Groups may want to **prepare ahead of time with presentations**, graphics, and props to enhance their presentations.
