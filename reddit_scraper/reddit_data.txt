- Me when I'm a tourist and I see a tourist:
- I live in in Queenstown nz, you get a lot of people coming in from Japan and china, and Since they don’t do a lot of driving over there (good public transport)
It means they are notoriously bad drivers here
- There's tourists, and then there's *tourists*
- I've been living in one of these towns for a few years and I see it from both sides. On the one hand: people should be allowed to visit beautiful, touristy places. These areas are stunning and the local businesses are wonderful and locally owned. On the other hand: God fucking damn it I just want to go to the chemist to get my medication or do any of my normal day to day shit but no because its the holidays, you cannot move around the village. Get out of my way.
- I would like working retail a lot better if I didn't have to deal with customers.

Comments:
- That's not a former teammate, that's a friend!
- Damn, this made me cry.
- Love (the emotion) will always transcend anything this world throws at us, and it makes me happy.
- Nothing nothing replaces a friend like that
- This might be one of the first times that Kevin has been hugged like this by someone bigger than him since his dad died. It sounds silly, but I could see that as being pretty triggering (but in like a good, emotionally healthy way?) When dealing with the loss of a parent, who probably hugged him all the time when his dad was bigger than he was.

Comments:
- Great video. 

Talk about a dream come true. Who cares if first round or last getting picked at all has to be an amazing high. And to get picked by the Steelers? Even better.
- Can i just say how nice it is to see men not afraid to cry on camera now. I never liked seeing a man go through an experience (like this one) and instead of getting wrapped up in the moment, he's hiding away trying not to be seen crying. Cry my bro, you deserve it.
- I love the concerned dog when everyone gets emotional and starts jumping in the pool with their clothes on. They're like "so this is the end".
- I don’t care for Gob
- As an Oregon fan, he broke my heart this year. But man, seeing guys this excited at realizing their dreams is fucking heartwarming. I hope he kills it for Pittsburgh.

Comments:
- “It will be an unpaid role for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer, whose son, Shaqir O'Neal, will also play for Sacramento State under new coach Mike Bibby.”
- Shaqramento
- This won't end well
- They’ve been raising tons of NIL money. Not as dumb as people think.

They raised 35 mil in one day. Target 75 mil. He’s walking into a pretty good situation.

Edit: and a new arena. 

There’s been talks for months about “watch out for sac state” in the next few years. Money, state of art  facilities, and Shaq isn’t as dumb as he appears on tv.  Google his ownership stakes in companies, and his endorsement deals, he’s pretty savvy. And I was lucky to see prime Shaq end of Orlando and Lakers, the dude knows ball.  A lot of Redditors would be shocked that an entire defensive strategy was to send out bench warmers to literally “hack a Shaq.”

Edit 2: idk how old this is, but look at his portfolio. Even I didn’t know all this stuff 

[Shaq investments](https://wolfoffranchises.com/shaq-franchises/)
- Seeing the names Shaquille O'Neal and Mike Bibby together reminded me of a certain event that happened on May 31st 2002 that I still have not gotten over and makes me depressed and angry.

- I see this in F1 and it always cracks me up. 

All that engineering and the tear-offs are still around. You would think there would be some better way to do this where a driver doesnt have to manage it. I have seen races ended because they get sucked into the intake of their own car or the ones behind them.

- Regardless of his age situation, if bro was 32 years old and did this, it'd be nuts. To do this as a teenager is genuinely insane.
- Final Score: 101 runs off 38 balls, with 11 sixes and 7 fours
- Nah, this is insane. 

Absolutely unheard of, I've heard of prodigies having to bide their time and being deemed too young to make the step up, but this boy absolutely deserves to be where he is today. I just hope he stays humble and keeps his head down because this much talent at such a young age can either make or break you both personally and professionally.

I wish him all the best and will be keeping an eye on him!
- A special talent that we should all keep an eye on, for sure 👍🏽
- Amazing talent and that too Century off international bowlers.

Edit: for anyone interested in highlights of his full innings. Also, he scored this off international bowlers.

- Has there ever been a little league style grand slam in MLB?
- That was really cool to see. What a reaction and wholesome celebration!

- This is why a good coach drives it home to young hitters/runners, that you hustle on every hit, every base. You never know when a bad throw lets you pick up an extra base or even a run.

- This is what I’d want in a GM.  If radio hosts were GMing a team there would be 2 Cleveland Browns in the league
- Adding some context for those who only see the headlines -

The offense is not the problem. After last years playoff loss to the chi*fs, every fan called for changes to the defense. And big changes. Beane agrees, so he goes out and builds a draft class deep of defensive roles.  Then gets dragged about not prioritizing a WR role on this show. 

Idk about yall but I’d be short too if I were in his shoes.
- Radio hosts that have never played a snap of football nor stepped into a front office in their life.
- Responding to radio criticism is usually a constructive use of one's time.

Comments:
- Location:  US, Missouri

Price Range: 15K-30K

Lease or Buy:  Open to any

New or Used: Open to either

Type of Vehicle:  I prefer cars to SUVs or crossovers

Must have: reliable

Trans:  Auto

Intended use: daily driver.  *Maybe* 1 road trip a year if lucky

Vehicles you have considered:  considering EVs and Hybrids

Do you need a warranty: Idk

Can you do minor work: Yes

Can you do major work:  Probably not but willing to try

Additional notes:

Considering an EV but Im not sure if its right for me or not.

I want something that is low maintenance and is reliable (im sick of constantly doing repairs on my VW GTI)

At the moment I commute 3 times a week, sometimes 4 (but rarely).

commute is 16 miles (so 32 miles round trip).

I pick my kid up from school every weekday but thats only 2.5 mile round trip.

So on an average week I drive about 108.5 miles plus shopping/other short trips.

I own my own home.

I might go on one road trip a year, which is something I do enjoy. I currently do it in what is basically a VW Golf.

Its just me and my kid so I dont need a ton of space. Maybe someday I will have a partner with me, I dont know.

I wouldnt spend over 30K and would prefer it to be around or under 20K but I probably have some flexibility.

I prefer cars to SUVs or crossovers but I could be flexible.
- US

Under 10k

Used

Stock limited slip differential RWD trucks and SUVs

I'm specifically looking for trim levels that came standard with a LSD, and what to look for when checking used listings. You can spot second gen dakotas with LSDs by looking for rear disc brakes, for example. But I'm wondering what the tells are for GM and ford products
- 2011 Honda CRV with 108k miles, 1 owner. $9k sell price, non negotiable with dealer (TX)

Howdy. So a local dealership has a 2011 Honda CRV with 108k miles. It’s had 2 owners, has about 30 history records of work, and had a minor damage report but it’s 2 hail spots that you can barely see.

$9k is about $1k out of my budget but I can wiggle it up if the price is worth it.

This car would mostly be used for in town trips for errands/appts and the over so occasional out of town trip (like once a quarter)

Does this car sound worth it? They’re getting some stuff fixed up right now so I threw down a deposit so we can hold to see it after it’s repaired.

Its also for my mom who needs to use a cane/walker, so anything that’s not too high or too low to the ground to get in and out of, along with a trunk that’s easy to access, would be ideal.

Additional Notes:
This is our second car as both me and my spouse have to now work from office. Additionally, we were thinking of getting a car that is not too huge for my spouse to drive but also has ample space in the back (2nd) row for the occasional road trips. We have a BMW 330i and hate the minimal space in the back row for those occasional road trips. We are super confused between gas, EV and hybrid cars. We dreamt of buying a Porsche Macan but have read from multiple sources that the space in the back row is pretty tight.
- Looking to get a GMC Yukon or Chevy Tahoe. The 2025 versions are quite pricy and the dealers are trying to clear their lots of 2024 models. There’s a 2024 Yukon XL Denali that was a demo car at 1,800 miles at a very good price. Are there any major downsides to buying a demo car and what are the types of things u would watch out / ask for? Thanks!!

Post Title: Edmunds: Our Porsche Macan EV Cannot Justify Its $100,000 Price Tag
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1ka2929/edmunds_our_porsche_macan_ev_cannot_justify_its/
Comments:
- The depreciation on these is going to be eye-popping, right?
- I guess to play devil's advocate, none of the high end EV's are actually worth the asking price. They depreciate like a challenger on its 3rd E-2 owner and they become outdated in under a year.

I'm sure this will be like most of those cars though where it's only ever leased, and actual purchases are rare.
- I’ve driven this car, and while I liked the dynamics a lot, so much of the pricing is the Porsche tax.

It also has an embarrassing interior, a super cramped backseat and very poor luggage space for its class.

My best friend has a BMW iX, and it’s a better car than the Macan 4S in almost every way except looks and costs half as much to lease.

But again, it’s Porsche, so at least 30% of the price goes toward the brand. 

It’s not like my parents’ $80k 2022 Macan S can justify the price either. The interior of that car is worse than a new Hyundai.

Edit: to illustrate how cheap feeling the interior of Porsches are, this is the door panel of a $100k Macan 4S: https://imgur.com/FC3YaLe

Edit 2: this is the cheap center console of the Macan: https://i.imgur.com/eGYn3R4.jpeg Those cup holders would look sad in a Nissan Versa.
- Tbh, that’s always been a long time complaint about the Macan and Porsche in general.

On paper the car stars at a competitive price, but in order to reach feature parity with the competition, it costs a ton more (I remember contrasting stitching costing like, $2000)

The strategy to buying a good value Porsche is to really pick out exactly the features you want on the order sheet, and not a single thing more. But I always thought it was a strategy to push you to buy new - you’ll never find a used Porsche with the exact options you want. And the “loaded ones” with all the options checked were so expensive new, even used they cost a ton
- Dealer begged me to come drive one of these a few months ago. This is exactly what I said. It is very nice. It drives like a Porsche. But it sure didn’t feel like 100k vehicle or experience. Honestly I found it a bit boring. “It’ll make a perfect run-about for somebody’s wife.”

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1k9vwvl/we_found_the_full_list_of_all_677081_cars_killed/
Comments:
- This just confirms that car guys overdramatized the hell out of cash for clunkers.
- This list has been available for more than 10 years. What are they doing here?
- This has been a Google Sheet for over a decade now of the sheet and the discussion inevitably focuses on all those Ford Explorers that totally would still be on the road today while ignoring the \~20M cars not produced between 2008-2013 because we were in near economic collapse. 

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1IACg](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1IACg)

Those are the 12-17 year old cars that would be filling the bottom of the used car market now and not a 1995 Ford Explorer that would have blown a head gasket around 2010 and been sent to the crusher.
- RIP all those XJ Cherokees :(
- God, I remember being so pissed over this.

Not over the program in general. But because I had traded in my beat-to-shit Jeep Cherokee a few weeks before it started and got like $600 for it. Had I waited a few weeks, I could have gotten the full C4C amount.

- They cut their 2025 revenue estimate by only about 6%, but made it clear they’re not factoring in any new tariffs. Does anybody really doubt that some level of tariffs will stick around?
- Has Porsche (or Audi for that matter) resumed deliveries of vehicles to the US? I had heard they were diverting all new vehicles to a holding area and relying upon existing stock for sale

Post Title: Wear and tear of “high speed” driving?
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1kacf6q/wear_and_tear_of_high_speed_driving/
Comments:
- Negligible 
- The most wear of our engines happens at start up. Once the engine is warmed up, it doesn’t matter what RPM you run it at, the wear is negligible.
- The most significant wear will be on your tires, brakes, and wheel/axle bearings.
- Stop and go driving is way harder on your car than driving it at a higher rate of speed.
- This is a really interesting question that has super little practical use. I'm curious to know the answer as well but realistically it doesn't matter that much

Post Title: Spy Shots Show Refreshed C8 Corvette Interior With an Updated Wall &amp; Three Displays
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/1ka3efv/spy_shots_show_refreshed_c8_corvette_interior/
Comments:
- I love the stingray motif where the wall meets the dash. 

As much as I dislike the design of the c8 corvette, they absolutely succeeded at making it look like a stingray.

Now if they could just kindly tidy up the rear end?
- Honestly? I liked the wall of buttons; it was and is a defining characteristic of the C8 generation, and apparently is easy to use once one gets familiar with it. That said, this updated interior does look pretty slick. I especially like the metal A/C toggle shaped controls that now sit underneath the center display. 

I also like how they still kept the, “spine” of the wall of buttons intact, just now acting as a grab handle of sorts. It’ll be interesting to see the little differences that the Z06, ZR1, E-Ray, and likely Zora will have between each other here.
- That tablet looks like it's about to tip over and fall off
- I love the new interior. I feel like it still retains a cockpit vibe, while being better ergonomically.
- I mean it’s interesting. Surprised they didn’t just go for 1 long screen like BMW’s, Mercedes, and Lucid been doing. Kinda look like it would fit nicely in a Corvette tbh.

1. Lexus RX: 24,716 units sold
- As someone not in the US I have never understood Buicks being luxury cars, they shared parts with Vauxhalls &amp; Opels in the past, have plastic interiors ( probably are nicer is the brand new models ) &amp; are FWD based are they not?
- Buick is considered luxury brand?
- I believe this means the Escalade remains as the best selling vehicle with an average 100k price tag. Even more so when you add the Escalade IQ with ICE Escalade. That's so crazy
- LMAO the x3 selling that poorly is such a good thing for car design

- No one sane is paying almost 70k for a mustang, there are much better options at that price range
- No one with a brain is paying the asking $55-60k for this shit. The entire premise of a muscle car is cheap RWD v8 power, not all the stupid gadgets and software the car is coming with that are hiking the price to the moon. 

You might as well put a little more down and buy a c8 Corvette instead, which is also struggling but not as bad
- Shouldn’t have dropped the manual on the ecoboost! (Also shouldn’t have priced the ecoboost like the GT)
- Wow! Sales are down after prices are hiked to unreasonable levels!

- Does Pokemon Center ever restock? I have been trying to get a hoodie for a few years now, but it is always sold out.
- What are the odds on them doing a monthly mythical Pokemon event for the 30th next year?

I think for the 20th they did a thing were they would distribute a new mythical each month,sadly my saves from the 3DS era are long gone and I dont even think I knew it was going on back then cause I was,like,12 and I missed out on ones like Zarude and Zeroara and Marshadow because I took a break from the series while they were being released

I'm working on a living dex and mythicals are a massive hole in the progress

Post Title: With Abomasnow having so many weaknesses I wonder how many people have used one on their team?
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1ka2btv/with_abomasnow_having_so_many_weaknesses_i_wonder/
Comments:
- The unfortunate part for Abomasnow was how late in the game you get him in gen4.  By that point you are working towards your 7th badge and have a pretty evolved team.  If you could have gotten him around the second gym I'm sure he would have gotten more love in a region with no fire types
- From what I understand, it's actually pretty good in SV. Terastalizing lets it improve its type, and Hail changing to Snow means its ability has more benefits and lost its drawbacks, and those were its two big sticking points.
- Focus Sash + Snow Warning (defensive buffs in snow in gen ix).

Aurora Veil, Ingrain, Giga Drain, Blizzard, or some other moves can help you recover and hit hard.
- Doesn’t help that in it’s debut generation not only do you encounter Snover late into the game after you’ve already beaten both the grass and water gyms, but by the time you do you’ll already have access to better grass types, plus most water types can learn ice type moves like ice beam, and even then there are better ice types you can catch in the same areas as Snover
- I once used mega Abomasnow in a fangame, using a mode with reversed type matchups... it was still bad lol

Comments:
- Imagine dying in the hospital ready to see your loved ones in the afterlife, only for a waiting Chandelure to burn your soul out of existence.
- Fun fact: the whole "starting your Pokémon journey at age 10" is basically only a thing in the anime. As in the games, Wally is the only character with a canon age to be 10 years old

Pokémon protagonists usually start their journey at 11 at the youngest, but there's also Hilda and Hilbert (who both canonically start their journey at 14) aswell as Rei and Akari (who start their journey at 15)

(there's also post game dialogue in XY that seems to imply that the game versions of Serena and Calem are older than Emma, who is canonically 16, although nothing has been confirmed)
- Gen I early Beedrill with poison sting and fury attack until lv 20
- Still preferable to other fictional worlds.
- As far as I remember in the anime anytime there was a swarm of Beedrill it was directly after someone inevitably attacked their nest, just avoid randomly throwing rocks at trees and your fine

Any high end cards to note? If a bunch hit a pawn shop or store at once that are common to your binder it would be telling

Tell as much as possible for any hope

- It's sad because whenever a game or system announces some cool multiplayer feature, it's like, yeah wow if I had friends who played video games anymore that would be great.
- Looking at Steam friends list of buddies I used to game with on the daily… “last online 7 years ago” 🥲
- It's more depressing when I boot up my old 360 and see what used to be. 
- I used to be an adventurer like you, then all my friends left me

Comments:
- The little scene of Gustave and Lune arguing by the Indigo Tree cemented this game's writing to me, I can't remember the last time I saw video game characters believably talk over one another like that and it nail the landing. Most of the time it's 2 character assets waiting for the other to finish before talking again, also the music, every map area has it's own battle theme with overworld and boss track and I cannot think of any one of them I dislike.
- Again, Sven from Larian being proven right from the Game Awards when he talked about the next GOTY

This game deserves everything is receiving. This game is something special. Onions have been cut a couple of times. 

The combat is so refreshing. Mixing turned based and tactical together, the incredible score and visuals. 

The love that was poured into this game from such a small studio, really makes me smile.

And still you have huge devs, spending zillions of dollars releasing crap that is full of microtransactions and loot boxes. This game should be a lesson to all developers.
- It's somewhat of a perfect storm of the players feelings towards the industry and the way some of these companies release the same game with a different skin, expecting us to pay top prices. 

It's fresh, it's new, it's actually guite good, it's from a new team. The game hits all the right notes. It would be wild as fuck if they won GOTY over some of the other releases whose development costs absolutely dwarf E33's
- Imagine telling someone a month ago that a small budget title made by ex Ubisoft devs will break all sorts of records lmao.
- How they made this game like 40gb is beyond my comprehension, and it runs so incredibly well.

Comments:
- The oblivion gates are so terrifying. They absolutely nailed the visuals
- So it looks like Kingdom Come 2, Oblivion Remaster and Clair Obscur are all big successes this year and it's not even the end of April yet. 

Yet, EA came out and said single player RPGs don't work cause players want live service elements in them.
- And definitely acts as a fix until the next elder scrolls game comes out in 5 years ... 4 if we're lucky
- 60 bucks well spent. Initially thought of waiting for a sale but upon seeing everything revealed and initial gameplay from YouTubers, I knew it was a day one buy for sure. If they do Fallout 3 or New Vegas those will be day one as well if they’re like this.
- It's only a win if they are able to learn the right lesson from this success. 

But I have a feeling all we will see in the future is a terrible Elder Scrolls 6 release followed by a fantastic Morrowind remaster

Comments:
- Saving yall a click. Russia intends to seize a subsidiary studio, Lesta, that split from Wargaming in 2022. Citing Wikipedia, Lesta was left to manage the live services in Russia after the split. May affect access to their games in Russia, unlikely to see impact outside of Russia.
- I’m not so sure it’s a good idea to fuck with the “world of tanks” people.
- I think Russia is running out of tanks, and they want people's accounts for more tanks. /s
- We’re all still reeling from the revelation that a T-90M can get wrecked by a Bradley’s 25mm autocannon.
- Russia can't seize anything Wargaming as they got the fuck out of there as soon as the war started. Lesta has no connection to Wargaming on the development level and I belive Lesta was sold so it didn't stay as subsidiary of WG. WG wanted to split from Russia in any way possible. 

I read the article only very quickly, but either the writers or Russian officials haven't done their research. Seizing Lesta is "as good as" seizing any random IT company.

Post Title: Wish we could break the MQ in Oblivion like Morrowind
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ka2iw3/wish_we_could_break_the_mq_in_oblivion_like/
Comments:
- I just wish we could modify our spellbook.  Or at least have a "favorites" tab.  So many spells become redundant once you get more powerful.
- It should be noted that you can only continue the main quest with certain NPC's being dead.  There are absolutly some NPC's that if killed will just mean the end of the main quest, there is no "figuring it out" (surprisingly, Vivic is not one of them).  At least not in a true completion sense, you can still kill the heart I suppose.

Faction quests are where it got real messy though, you kill the wrong NPC you can effectively end one of the major questlines and unlike the main quest there is no pop-up telling you that you messed up.
- MQ = Main quest.

Explain your abbreviations, people. 

Sydney morning herald
- I still remember playing Fallout 4, and you finally meet THAT character you’ve been searching for - well, he introduces himself, and before I even let him get to the twist I pull out my handgun and murder him on the spot. 

Boom. 

Alarms start going off, a million NPCs are swarming me, and as I’m fighting to survive I’m just seeing an absolute cascade of “quest failed” notifications piling on as I just gutted the entire main storyline for the rest of the story. 

But the game *let me do it anyway*. 

Moments like this are where Bethesda really shines
- I've had to reload quite a few times in Oblivion after messing up major side quests. 

In particular, the final Thieves Guild quest where you &gt;!steal an Elder Scroll!&lt;can be irrevocably lost if you go out the wrong way after going through the sewers. I tried to retrace my path, but doors were permanently shut. So, had to reload back quite a ways to fix my screw up. 

Not quite the same to what you're saying. But, kind of proves that games in general have progressively strayed away from the "you should have read the instructions, dumbass" approach towards quest building.

Comments:
- &gt;marks the MCU's 36th film

Geez I never really saw that spelled out before. That's crazy. 

I guess kicking off **17** years ago is what didn't sink in with me. 2.12 movies a year average and not counting all the TV shows.
- What an insane performance by Sinners. This movies WOM can't be stopped. I 100% expect a 300+M DOM finish. Unprofitable my ass.
- The Accountant 2 found itself blindsided by Sinners and RotS. I’m a pretty passive observer here but based on people fondness for the first and the marketing I thought it was gonna be a hit, but who could see this coming? Ended up choosing a terrible date.
- The trailers for Until Dawn made it seem like a time loop movie where every loop would be a different horror. Im down with that idea. I was not down with how the movie played out. At first it seems like it’s gonna be like that, then they fast forward to the last night. Even then they could have done a montage of deaths but instead we get cell phone footage of like 3-4 of the loops. 

Also I never played the game but they clearly try to shoe horn it in, with Dr. Hill, the random photo of rami malek and that end shot of the cabin.

Honestly I should of seen Sinners a second time.
- Sinners is amazing , its has amazing legs too

Comments:
- While the cast list may be even bigger than Endgame/Infinity War (including new faces like Shang chi and old faces like the old X-Men), I get the feeling it won't have the emotional and character driven attachment that the Infinity Saga had with its tighter group of characters that had been properly built up over the 20+ movies heading into those films.

Everything in the Multiverse saga feels so disparate with a lot of characters introduced (to positive reception) but nothing done with them since.
- We're never gonna recapture the magic that was the Infinity War and Endgame period.
- Just the thought of the actor schedules gives me a headache
- It sucks that they are just going to skip the Kang. They should've recast him, rather than just abandoning the whole character and arc. 
- A lot of hype riding on this one. If it turns out to be underwhelming, it might be the end of the MCU honestly.

- Well Monkey Man made $35M on a $10M budget so a small profit - I suppose giving Dev Patel another film in the same ballpark seems reasonable
- That title is really confusing. I spent way too much time wondering how I could have missed the first four seasons.
- "the project is being described as having shades of Braveheart and John Wick as well as notes of King Arthur as it mashes up Medieval knights with feudal India."

Hosoda is a hit or miss for me as I love Wolf Children and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. I thought Summer Wars, Belle and Mirai was just fine and The Boy and the Beast to be annoying. I'm curious to see what Hosoda offers next 
- Young Malenia? Is she soloing someone in turn?
- "Belle" was the most mixed I had ever felt on a movie, but by virtue of the things that worked being so utterly good it's always remained with me. I'm excited to see what Scarlet's gonna be like and thrilled to see an original animated movie outside of normal percieved genre norms (even if anime's the one section of world animation that always seems to get to have those big swings) be supported globally with the backing of a major blockbuster studio.
- Somebody’s been playing Elden Ring
- It’s coming to North American theaters December 12:

&gt;Scarlet, a princess who failed to avenge the murder of her father, the king, wakes up in the "Land of the Dead”. In this land, where madness abounds, Scarlett must take revenge on her sworn enemy and reach "The Endless Place," or else she will cease to exist.

- Just make it all a meme and go on tour with Perry
- Ticketmaster/livenation ruined live entertainment.  They punish people who want to go to events by charging significantly more when they go on sale than if you wait until the last minute.    
  
Anything that isn't going to be an instant sellout is legitimately stupid to buy more than a day or 2 before the event.  
  
I always track ticket prices for events I go to. Last one I went to the seats I bought were $750 for a pair on release date.  I bought them the morning of the event for $150 total.
- Maybe consider, Idk, making the prices more affordable as the economy collapses
- if she had done fewer dates per venue, it would've been sold out pretty easily. 5 dates at sofi stadium is crazy.
- it’s 94% sold out and yall are acting like that’s the percentage of seats still available lmfao

&gt; Responding to the fan, Kaytranada shared his stance on phones being used at live shows and explained how the increasing number of people filming footage for social media marks a new “age” of performance which he isn’t a fan of.

&gt; “I think we have come in this age where everybody’s trying to catch a moment for their own social media presence,” he began. “It shows their appreciation instead of them dancing and enjoying shows like we used to do.”

&gt; “It looks mad awkward from where I stand as I’m acknowledging the appreciation,” he continued. “But we need to go back to where we used to be y’all. If you put your phone up, let’s move them hips at least!”
- Placebo did this a few years back at de montfort, Leicester. 

It was my first gig too, made it extra special. The security at the front would watch and shine their torches in the cameras of folks they spotted. 


This sudden urge to record everything is weird and this is coming from a dude who will close reddit, only to open it straight away again.
- As someone that loves bootlegs, I’d love if artists would release soundboard recordings from their live shows or given that they record video of most of them, release that footage too. This would likely immediately drop the amount of people recording apart from those who are doing it exclusively for social media. 

Hell, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard literally just did this for their last US tour and said they’ll try to continue doing it in the future. It’s fucking amazing being able to listen to the shows I went to anytime I want or hop on YouTube and actually watch it again.
- So ban it.

Tool, A Perfect Circle, Puscifer, and Carina Round all do this.

I just saw Machine Head on Saturday and they had a massive display telling everyone to keep their phones in their pockets for their set.

It's so great to not have a sea of phones polluting the view and experience and seeing people actually being present and living in the moment.
- I was watching my friends insta videos of the Lady Gaga concert in Mexico City last night, and him everyone in front of him was standing completely still filming and not dancing as she was singing banger after banger after banger. Bummed me out. I’m going in December, and I really hope more people dance.

- Haven’t heard this one in maybe 25 years or so.
- This reminds me of warped tour 97

Post Title: Phish Snubbed by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Despite Winning Fan Vote
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k9jhq6/phish_snubbed_by_rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame/
Comments:
- “Rather than equitably considering fan input, the Rock Hall considers the totality of the fan vote to be just one of 1,200 ballots. In other words, the top five artists in the fan vote are placed on a single ballot, which is then considered just one of the hundreds of ballots submitted by industry professionals, other performers, historians, and more.”

So the fan vote is worth less than 0.1%.
- Ask any Iron Maiden fan if the rock 'n roll hall of fame is worth a damn.
- All good, they have been packing arenas consistently since the 90s while most bands have faded into obscurity. I’m just glad to have them around. The hall of fame is not a serious organization
- Generally I don’t care about Phish or the HoF but… seems crazy not to have them in it. Even people who’ve never heard a Phish song know who they are and what their deal is.
- Seems kind of funny that one of the most prominent pieces in the Rock Hall gallery is the Phish Hot Dog but they’re not actually in lol

Post Title: Weekly FAQ Thread April 27, 2025: How do I stay focused and remember more of what I'm reading?
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1k91ceh/weekly_faq_thread_april_27_2025_how_do_i_stay/
Comments:
- Maybe annotating the book would help.
- I rarely keep the books I purchase after I read them and often borrow from the library and was having this issue. So I decided to start a "book journal" where I write down parts of books that I like or find interesting, etc.

It's really nice to go through them and reread special or informative bits of the books I enjoyed and I have found that the simple act of writing it, like physically with a pen, helps me retain the information.
- Do you mostly like what you are reading or more precisely, did you it read cause you felt intrigued ? That’s the right question first
- A quiet place helps a lot for me. I immerse/imagine myself in the MC's setting so I can 'feel' the story thru the 5 senses.
- I find a quiet place with minimal distractions is helpful for me, otherwise it goes in but makes no sense.

Post Title: Weekly Recommendation Thread: April 25, 2025
Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1k7h6nh/weekly_recommendation_thread_april_25_2025/
Comments:
- I've recently read The Book of Doors by Gareth Brown and I loved it. Now I want to read more books in the magical realism genre. Does anyone have any recommendations?
- I've read all Rick Riordans, all wings of fire, all grishaverse, all hunger games, all a song of ice and fire, all lord of the rings, all rangers apprentice and brotherband, all harry potter and some other random books so far. Any good fantasy/novel thats not just a copy paste story, with a love plot on the side would be appreciated very very much
- Hi everyone, I have never been a super active reader as an adult but I used to read like 5-10 books a year. That stopped a couple years ago when I found reading was not bringing me joy anymore.


Recently, I watched the film American Fiction and loved it! I immediately bought ***Erasure* by Percival Everett** and I finished it in a week.


I'm looking for books to get me back to loving reading. Here's what I enjoy:  

* From Erasure, I really like the discussion of societal problems and the character's place in that system/problem.
* From Erasure, I like that the main character was both flawed and introspective. I liked that other characters were flawed but felt real and human.
* From Erasure, I like that the book articulated the character's internal struggles and dialogue.
* My favorite author is Khaled Hosseini, and I like his books for mostly the same reasons I liked Erasure.
* The last book that I finished before Erasure was ***I'm Glad My Mom Died* by Jennette McCurdy** which I liked for a lot of what it has in common with the books above.
* I conceptually love a genre like fantasy but I dislike books where there is a lot of made up jargon (if I don't know what a term means it really takes me out). If there's anything low fantasy without a low of jargon I might really like it.
* For writing style, Hosseini is about the densest prose I can read before I find it distracting/hard to get into. Ideally I'd be looking for something a little lighter than his writing style.
* For length, I'm looking for books shorter than 300pgs until I'm back into reading regularly again.

Examples listed above:  

* **Author: Khaled Hosseini** 
* ***Erasure* by Percival Everett** 
* ***I'm Glad My Mom Died* by Jennette McCurdy**

Thanks to anyone who actually reads this, sorry for the wall of text.
- Looking for a book/books about the Iroquois Nation/Haundenosaunee, hopefully a newer one with...varied perspectives.
- Hi, I'm after some recommendations of books with characters who you think have good judgment and/or AT LEAST have interesting thinking styles.

I know this sounds like an extremely subjective undertaking, but here are some examples of themes or characters I wouldn't be interested in:

* Women 'stuck' in abusive relationships &amp; trying to get out
* Teenagers trying hard to impress their crush
* Professionals who make concessions, leading to disasters
* People stuck in the wild without proper preparations
* People who hold onto a specific revenge plan despite knowing it's a bad idea after decades for purely 'emotional reasons'

Here are some books I really enjoyed:

* Red Dragon/Hannibal/Silence of the Lambs - Thomas Harris
* Flowers for Algernon - Daniel Keyes
* Everything/Nothing/Someone - Alice Carrière
* American Psycho - Bret Easton Ellis
* Kafka on the Shore - Haruki Murakami
* Rules of Civility - Amor Towles
* The Secret History - Donna Tart
* How to Murder Your Life - Cat Marnell
* Tokyo (Devil of Nanking) - Mo Hayder
* The Little Prince - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Hard request I know, but thanks!
