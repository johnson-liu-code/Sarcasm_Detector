    Create a dictionary of word vectors for the given list of words.
    
    Args:
        1. word_list (list): A list of words to create vectors for.
        2. word_vector_size (int): The size of each word vector.
    
    The Function:
        1. Iterates through each word in the word_list.
        2. Generates a random vector of size word_vector_size for each word.
        3. Stores the word and its corresponding vector in a dictionary.
        4. Returns the dictionary of word vectors.

    Returns:
        1. word_vectors: A dictionary mapping each word to its corresponding vector.
